# Bayesian Linear Regression in Julia

This is a simple package that does one thing, Bayesian Linear Regression, in around 100 lines of code.

## Intended Use and Functionality

The interface sits at roughly the same level as that of [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/). This means that while you won't find a scikit-learn-style `fit` function, you will find all of the primitives that you need to construct such a function to suite your particular problem. In particular, one can:

- Construct a `BayesianLinearRegressor` (BLR) object by providing a mean-vector and precision matrix for the weights of said regressor. This object represents a distribution over (linear) functions.
- "Index into" said distribution over functions to construct an `IndexedBLR` object, which represents a finite-dimensional marginal of a `BayesianLinearRegressor`.
- Compute the log marginal likelihood of a vector of observations.
- Sample from the finite-dimensional marginals of a BLR.
- Perform posterior inference to produce a new BLR with an update mean and precision.
- All operations are fully compatible with [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/) (hopefully), so you can use gradient-based optimisation to tune the hyperparameters of your regressor etc.

For examples of how to use this package in conjunction with Flux and Zygote, see the examples directory.

## Conventions

A `BayesianLinearRegressor` in `D` dimensions works with data where:
- inputs `X` should be a `D x N` matrix of `Real`s where each column is from one data point.
- outputs `y` should be an `N`-vector of `Real`s, where each element is from one data point.

## Up For Grabs

- Scikit-learn style interface: it wouldn't be too hard to implement a scikit-learn - style interface to handle basic regression tasks, so please feel free to make a PR that implements this.
- Monte Carlo VI (MCVI): i.e. variational inference using the reparametrisation trick. This could be very useful when working with large data sets and applying big non-linear transformations, such as neural networks, to the inputs as it would enable mini-batching. I would envise at least supporting both a dense approximate posterior covariance and diagonal (i.e. mean-field), where the latter is for small-moderate dimensionalities and the latter for very high-dimensional problems.

## Bugs, Issues, and PRs

Please do report and bugs you find by raising an issue. Please also feel free to raise PRs, especially if for one of the above `Up For Grabs` items. Raise an issue to discuss the extension in detail before opening a PR if you prefer though.


## Related Work

[BayesianLinearRegression.jl](https://github.com/cscherrer/BayesianLinearRegression.jl) is closely related, but appears to be a WIP and hasn't been touched in around a year or so (as of 27-03-2019).
